Log Parser in C

This is a simple **Log Parser program written in C** that reads a system log file (e.g., 'system.log') and filters out only the lines that contain the keyword "ERROR".

How It Works

- Opens the 'system.log' file in read mode.
- Reads each line from the file.
- Checks if the line contains the word 'ERROR'.
- If yes, prints that line to the console.
